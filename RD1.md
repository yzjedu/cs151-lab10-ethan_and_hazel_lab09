Objective
The objective of this lab was to practice working with files, tables (lists of lists), and functions to analyze movie data. We were expected to read data from a CSV file, calculate profits for each movie, and identify the movie with the highest profit. Additionally, we were supposed to write the updated data to a new output file while improving our understanding of breaking problems into smaller functions.

Procedure
* Steps Followed: Hazel and I started by discussing the problem and collaboratively designing the algorithm. Hazel took the lead on the algorithm, breaking it into smaller tasks like reading the file, calculating profit, and writing the updated data to a new file.
* Techniques Used: After finalizing the algorithm, I implemented the program. We used input validation to ensure the file existed, calculated profits for each movie row, and iterated through the data to find the highest-profit movie.
* Key Concepts Explored:
o Working with files (reading and writing)
o Manipulating tables (lists of lists)
o Writing reusable functions to handle distinct parts of the program

Results
* Expected vs. Actual Results: The program worked as expected. It correctly calculated the profits, added them as a new column, and identified the highest-profit movie.
* Test Cases Used: We tested with the provided movies.csv file, edge cases (e.g., empty files and files with invalid data), and extreme cases (movies with very high or negative profits). The program handled all cases correctly.



Reflection
* Challenges Encountered:
The main challenge was ensuring the program handled invalid files and edge cases well. 
* Following the 3 Rules of Programming:
1. Identify the Problem: Hazel and I worked together to clearly define the tasks for the algorithm.
2. Design and Plan: Hazel took the lead on creating a well-structured algorithm that guided the implementation.
3. Execute and Test: I focused on writing the program, testing various cases, and debugging issues with invalid data handling.
* Overcoming Challenges: We overcame challenges by testing extensively and debugging systematically. 
* Key Takeaways: I really deepened my understanding of files and worked with functions as I have for the past few weeks. This lab reinforced my understanding of file handling and table manipulation.
* Working with My Partner: Working with Hazel was a great experience. She took the lead during the algorithm design and ensured our plan was clear and logical. This made implementing the program much easier for me.
