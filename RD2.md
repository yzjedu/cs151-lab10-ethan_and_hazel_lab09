**What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?**

Analyze data on movies, their budgets, and their profits. 

**What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?**

First we read the readme file, then discussed the high level steps. After that we wrote the algorithm and then completed and tested the code.

**What were the Key concepts explored?**

1. Reading / Writing files
2. Functions
3. Tables


**Did your results match what you expected to get?**

Yes.

**Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?**

Yes. There is error checking in place when there is user input.

**What challenges did you encounter?**

I was a bit confused about creating the writing functions. 

**How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?**

1. Think before Programming: We read the read me file, and completed our algorithm before starting to program.
2. Program is the embodiment of the algorithm: Our code follows our algorithm
3. Improve through practice: We improved our pair programming / coding skills by completing this lab.


**Did you overcome them, and how?**

Yes. The lecture notes in the next class helped a lot. 

**Any key takeaways?**

Deciding High Level steps before doing the algorithm is very important.

**Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?**

Yes. I feel much more comfortable working with writing and reading files. 

**What was it like working with your partner?**

Good! He's very hardworking.
